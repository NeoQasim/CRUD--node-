Express Goal API Readme
This README.md file provides an overview of the Express Goal API project, which includes information about the project structure, how to set it up, and some brief explanations of the key components.

Project Overview
The Express Goal API is a simple API that allows users to interact with goals data. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing goals.

Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the Express Goal API on your local machine:

Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using Git.

bash
Copy code
git clone
Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm.

bash
Copy code
cd express-goal-api
npm install
Run the Server: Start the Express server.

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will run on port 21, and you should see the message "Server running on 21" in the console.

API Endpoints: You can now access the following API endpoints:

GET /get-data: Get all goals data.
POST /post-data: Create a new goal.
PUT /update-data/:id: Update a goal by its ID.
DELETE /delete-data/:id: Delete a goal by its ID.
Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

index.js: The entry point of the application. It sets up the Express server and defines the routes.

Routes/goalRoutes.js: Defines the API routes for handling goal-related operations.

Controller/GoalController.js: Contains the controller functions for handling the CRUD operations on goals.

Controller Functions
The controller functions are responsible for handling the logic of the API endpoints. Here's a brief overview of each function:

getGoals: Retrieves all goals data.
postGoals: Creates a new goal.
updateGoals: Updates a goal by its ID.
deleteGoals: Deletes a goal by its ID.
These functions send appropriate responses to the client, indicating the status of the operation.
